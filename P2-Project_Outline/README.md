# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will help donors to a non-profit organization choose the projects(s) they wish to fund and view their own record of giving in real time.  Conversely the organization will have a record of contributors by fund and of contributions by donors accessed by an administrative access log-in. Eventually, my project should incorporate third-party payment instruments, like Paypal or ApplePay, as options for donors to make contributions, but the minimum viable product will just keep records of contributions and provide report views for both individual contributors and the non-profit administrators.

### Features
Users will create their own sign-ins, and will eventually be able to use payment instruments to fund their contributions to different areas of the non-profit and their total contributions to the non-profit in real time.  The non-profit in turn will have administrator access to view the funds' contributors, and track fund balances.

Still need to push repository from Intelli-j

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to structure different levels of log-in access. I will perhaps learn to strenghten my front-end abilities to make my project have the highest user-experience possible.  Maybe the project could be expanded to help multiple organizations simultaneously, though I imagine this is truly a "backlog" idea.
